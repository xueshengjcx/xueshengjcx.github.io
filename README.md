# MSc in Mathematical Sciences

## About the course

The MSc in Mathematical Sciences, known as the Oxford Master's in Mathematical Sciences (OMMS), provides a broad and flexible training in mathematical sciences and gives students with a keen interest in the mathematical sciences the chance to study a selection of interesting and varied master's-level courses.

***

Oxford has a world-class reputation in the mathematical sciences, and this master's offers students the opportunity to join Oxford's current fourth-year undergraduates and to work with an international group of peers, including other mathematical leaders of the future.

This course draws on subjects in mathematics, statistics and computer science: from number theory, geometry and algebra to genetics and mathematical physiology; from probability and mathematical geoscience to data mining and machine learning. You have the opportunity to choose from many options, tailoring the programme to your individual interests and requirements. This course runs from the beginning of October through to the end of June.

### Teaching and learning

You will attend at least six units' worth of courses (with one unit corresponding to a 16-hour lecture course supported by classes) in addition to writing a dissertation (worth two units). You will be encouraged to work collaboratively in classes, to develop your understanding of the material. Those wishing to extend themselves further might take one or two additional courses.

Depending on how many courses you take in total and how they split between terms, you can expect to attend two, three or four (or, in exceptional cases, five) lecture courses per term. Each lecture course has two one hour lectures per week supplemented by four 90 minute classes per term. 

The remainder of your study time in the first two terms should be spent on self-study, consolidating on the material covered in lectures, working through the problem sheets set for each class and working independently on your
dissertation. In the third term you will mostly work independently on your revision for exams, although optional revision classes will also be available to help guide your studies.

### Dissertation

The MSc offers a substantial opportunity for independent study and research in the form of a dissertation. The dissertation is undertaken under the guidance of a supervisor and will typically involve investigating and writing in a particular area of mathematical sciences, without the requirement (while not excluding the possibility) of obtaining original results. A dissertation gives students the opportunity to develop broader transferable skills in the processes of organising, communicating, and presenting their work, and will equip students well for further research or for a wide variety of other careers.

You can expect a one hour meeting with your dissertation supervisor at the end of the first term, followed by a further three one hour meetings in the second term.

Please note that this course is not suitable for students whose primary focus is mathematical finance. These students should apply to the MSc in Mathematical and Computational Finance.

### Supervision

The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Mathematical Institute and the Department of Statistics and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Mathematical Institute and the Department of Statistics.

### Assessment

The majority of lecture courses on the master’s are assessed by invigilated written examinations, although a minority of courses are assessed by a take-home exam known as a mini-project. The dissertation work culminates in a written report of approximately 25 to 35 pages and constitutes two of the minimum eight units you are required to take to complete the course.

### Graduate destinations

It is expected that graduates will pursue a rich diversity of careers across academia and a wide range of industries.

### Changes to this course and your supervision

The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made in circumstances of a pandemic (including Covid-19), epidemic or local health emergency. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.

Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.

For further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.

## Resources

The Mathematical Institute’s home is the purpose-built Andrew Wiles Building, opened in 2013. The building provides ample teaching facilities for lectures and classes. The mezzanine level is home to six lecture theatres and six classrooms, as well as a café and study spaces. There is also a student workroom located on this level which contains a number of computers and desks to facilitate quiet study. The Mathematical Institute has wifi available throughout the building and offers IT support for students.

For those students taking courses or dissertation topics in the relevant subject area, you will have access to the various facilities at the Department of Statistics. The building is newly refurbished and contains spaces for study and collaborative learning, including a large interaction and social area on the ground floor. The Department of Statistics has two lecture rooms and two classrooms, as well as an IT teaching lab. Students will have also have access to the IT and library resources at the department.

The Mathematical Institute is proud to have received an Athena SWAN silver renewal award in 2021, reflecting its commitment to promoting diversity and to creating a working environment in which students and staff alike can achieve their full potential. In addition, the Department of Statistics was awarded an Athena SWAN bronze award in 2017. The departments offer extensive support to students, from regular skills training and career development sessions to a variety of social events in a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
